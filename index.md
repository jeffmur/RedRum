### Gameplay
Hotel RedRum is a randomly generated action RPG shooter with heavy Rogue-like elements. An interesting mix of [The Binding of Issac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/) and [Enter the Gungeon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/311690/Enter_the_Gungeon/), where on his journey players will find bizarre items, weapons, and enemies that will determine if he will survive. 
###### Keep in mind this game is currently under development with new features on the way.

### What is Hotel RedRum
'RedRum' obviously coined from the 1980's hit Film _The Shining_ allowed our development team to focus on a theme that would warn players of a treacherous and unforgiving path ahead, however the gameplay shows a friendly main character _Casper_ and kid friendly enemies.
